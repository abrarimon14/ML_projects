# ML_projects
Some of my machine learning projects &amp; some of my python solutions to ML problems from textbooks

multiple_regression: includes hypothesis testing for each predictor variables for variable selection

stock_market_classification: using lag features to train many classification models to predict whether the price will go up or down in the future

simulating_data_CV: testing different linear models with LOOCV on simulated data

bagging_boosting: bagging & boosting models are trained and compared, includes use of one-hot encoding

clustering_pca: hierarchical clustering (with correlation based distance) is applied to to group different types of genes; different methods for linkage are compared through dendograms
